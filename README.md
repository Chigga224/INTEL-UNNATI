# INTEL-UNNATI
--So, This is a github repository made to display our work on the project topic of Vehicle Cut-In Detection 
--We have used several references both given by our external mentor Amartya Saikiya and our own research.
--Some major changes in the codes that wer causing errors were also rectfied by our own effort and also with the help of generative AI such as Llama and Chat-GPT;
--The test python file is provided in the github resporitory
--We were unable to find good results from the model we trained as we were unable to get footages on cut-in scenarios as it will take longer time for us to take all the necessary datas.
--Our file cars2.mp4 that has the sample footage and output recording was too large for the github resporitory so I attach the google drive link here

-- This is a pseudo-failed model though our efforts were given we were unable to provide a clear output of cut-in within these 4 weeks due to lack of fundamental knowledge on these AI background concepts and lack of resources in the field of cut-in that we require.
--Thanks for the oppurtunity you provided for us to perform in this industrial training provided by Intel corp
